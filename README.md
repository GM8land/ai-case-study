# CASE STUDY - Diffbot

## Overview and Origin

Diffbot was Founded in 2012 by Mike Tung (CEO)

As a grad student studying AI at Stanford circa 2011, Mike Tung was working on an algorithm to understand human language, which would require an extremely large model to accomplish. The most comprehensive source of data that could be used to train a model exists on the World Wide Web, but the solution to extracting and training the vast amount of unstructured data would require automation.  Around that time, he was exposed to Computer Vision (Image Net) and saw the potential of using Machine Learning to train large models. This early work building a solution to query, structure, and synthesize the data was the foundation of Diffbot's web crawler. In 2012, 

First round of startup funding ($2M) was received in 2012, followed by 3 subsequent rounds of Venture Capital funding totaling  $13M   

## Mission Statement and Business Activities

”Diffbot’s Mission is to accelerate the advent of intelligent systems by building the first autonomous system capable of synthesizing human knowledge. We crawl the entire public web and operate the world's largest automated Knowledge Graph.” (diffbot.com)

Diffbot’s business is focused on AI, Market Intelligence, Web Data Extraction, and Content Aggregation

Diffbot provides knowledge services to more than 400 companies worldwide by making large amounts of structured granular data. As of 2022, there are 5.9 billion entities with an average of 31 facts available for each within Diffbot’s Knowledge Graph that are available to customers through API access. Examples of data types include organizations, images, news articles, retail products, discussions, and events. 

Key industries in Diffbot’s customer base include Finance, Marketing, Media, and Technology. Notable large enterprise customers of Diffbot include Dow Jones, FINRA, Cisco, eBay, NBC, The New York Times, and AstraZeneca.   

Technologies used by Diffbot include: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP),  Knowledge Graphs, and APIs.

## Landscape - Trends and Developments

Advances in Machine Learning have led to improved algorithms for both data extraction from web pages and the creation of more accurate and comprehensive knowledge graphs.

Semantic web technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language are allowing for more effective integration and analysis of web data.

The concept of "Linked Data" has gained prominence and has led to the creation of large-scale knowledge graphs that connect diverse sources of information.

An increased emphasis on real-time web crawling has evolved in response to the major growth of social media and availability of real-time data, requiring development of new techniques to extract and update information from constantly evolving web sources. 

Knowledge graphs have become an essential component of many AI systems as companies utilize structured knowledge graphs to enhance their search engines, virtual assistant platforms, and recommendation systems.

There is a growing emphasis on ensuring responsible data acquisition, compliance with regulations, and addressing concerns related to data ownership and consent.

## Landscape - Competitive

Other major companies in this field include Google, Microsoft (Bing), Octopus Data, Scrapinghub, ParseHub, Import.io, Bright Data, Oxylabs, and Smartproxy 

Diffbot leverages a significant advantage among its main competitors (Google and Microsoft (Bing) are also crawling and structuring the web’s data) by developing and maintaining the world’s largest knowledge graph to collect and structure data autonomously in real-time. Its automation allows it to parse billions of datapoints daily, a scale that is not feasible for most businesses. Additionally, it is the only one which allows all data to be downloaded and integrated, and because it maintains its own hardware infrastructure, customers can access large amounts of Machine Learning and data processing much more efficiently and cheaply.(diffbot.com)

## Business Impact and Results

The structured data available on Diffbot’s Knowledge Graph is used by more than 400 companies to improve market intelligence and make better-informed business decisions, obtain valuable customer insights to deepen customer engagement, and streamline content creation and curation.

In addition to the standard metrics common to all businesses, examples of the functional metrics that companies in this field use to measure success include Accuracy, Coverage, Speed Data Freshness, Usability, and Compliance/Governance.  

Specific functional metrics for Diffbot are not available, however, Diffbot reported revenues of $2.3M in 2023 vs $1.9M in 2021, a YOY increase of 11.8%, and the company has a 4.9 out of 5 stars based on 29 verified reviews on g2.com.

## Recommendation

Diffbot uses the web as the source of unstructured data for its knowledge graph and services, and excels at this by keeping their core mission simple. In order to build on their competitive advantage without changing that scope, I would recommend integrating the extraction and synthesis of additional unstructured data sources from mobile phones and the Internet of Things (IOT)

Mobile devices collect large amounts of data at an individual level, and are generally physically present wherever the device owner is located. The data that is collected by mobile phones such as location data presents a compelling opportunity for Diffbot to deepen their competitive advantage with the addition of a dense real-time data source to their Knowledge Graph. Devices that are connected to the Internet of Things offer another data-rich environment that can be tapped and potentially add to the semantic data available. 

The core technologies required for this (Machine Learning, Knowledge Graphs, APIs) are already in use by Diffbot.
